    <H1>Human Design Is Blowing Up. Following It Might Make You Leave Your Spouse</H1>
    <h3>The astrology-like system uses birth dates to break people into personality types and even find love and riches.
        From sleeping arrangements to diets, some are taking it very seriously
    </h3>

    <p>According to human design, the New Age “synthesis” of astrology, the I Ching book of Chinese wisdom, Kabbalah,
        and the chakra system, “everyone should sleep in their own bed at night” to preserve their auras, says the blond
        38-year-old Los Angeles County–based surfer, who’s been following the practice rigidly for the past five years.
    </p>
    <p>“She was not happy and really hated having to go back to her place,” says Day, now a human design coach with
        11,000 followers on Instagram. He didn’t know how much the “auric distancing” bothered her, he says, “until she
        finally expressed it when we were breaking up.”
    </p>
    <p>Human design dictates that people inevitably fall into five archetypal personality categories: “manifestors,”
        generators, manifesting generators, reflectors, and projectors. The mystical, mechanical inner-discovery system
        turned Day’s life around when he spontaneously received a reading on a beach just outside of LA in August 2020.
        He was at a financial and emotional “rock bottom” amid the failure of his “beachproof” dog accessory brand, but
        that initial personality analysis represented “the first time someone actually saw me.” <br>Day was told that he
        was projector and that he shouldn’t hustle hard but instead follow the intuition of his spleen, the
        little-understood organ in the upper abdomen that is traditionally believed to be the seat of bad temper.
        <br>“For a long time I had depression and talked terribly to myself,” the California native tells me over a Zoom
        call. “But human design showed me that I actually hated not being me.” <br>Human design, a philosophy that spans
        from self-improvement to more extreme beliefs like life being predetermined, alien influence on Earth, and a
        coming planetary shift, is approaching a high-watermark cultural moment. It might not be long before the phrase,
        “that’s so mani-gen” is as common, in certain circles, as “that’s so Leo.” Some human design coaches have more
        than 100,000 followers on social media, offering people advice on everything from love lives to how to get
        rich.<br> There are coaching programs and entire centers dedicated to learning and teaching the practice as
        retreats are cropping up in wellness hot spots from Puerto Escondido, Mexico, to Sofia, Bulgaria. Readings can
        cost hundreds of dollars; TikTok creator Kendra Hilty, who went viral after documenting how she fell in love
        with her psychiatrist, received $3,000 for three months of weekly human design readings, according to The Cut.
        Even as I’m writing this article, I pass a bookstore in Vancouver, British Columbia, with a human design book
        prominently displayed in its front window.<br>The buzz around this radical system has led people to take
        life-changing decisions like ending their marriages or moving countries after single readings, which can also be
        conducted with ChatGPT. “You may realize you don’t love your partner, you hate your job, you can’t stand where
        you live, and you’re dying inside,” Day says. But he tells WIRED there are culty elements in the ecosystem of
        training connected to this “new astrology.”
